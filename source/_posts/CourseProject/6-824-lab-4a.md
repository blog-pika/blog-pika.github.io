## Lab 4A Design Overview

The design of Lab 4A is almost same as Lab3A: [6.824 Lab 3A - Key/value service without log compaction](https://blog-pika.github.io/2019/09/05/CourseProject/6-824-lab-3a/#more). The only difference is that in Lab 3A clients are sending `Get`, `Put`, `Append` to servers, and servers apply these commands to their key-value pairs; in Lab 4A, clients are sending `JOIN`, `LEAVE`, `MOVE`, `QUERY` to servers, and servers apply these commands to their Configs.

One impressive is due to RPC (should be trivial and easy to be found if you are familiar with Golang RPC). In Lab 3A, `Op` contains all fields of `PutAppendArgs` + `PutAppendReply`:

```go
type Op struct {
    Operation  string
    Key        string
    Value      string
    ClientId   int
    OpSequence int
}
```

In Lab 4A, `Op` is a nested struct includes Args.  
the following definition:

```go
type Op struct {
    CommandType CommandType
    Args        interface{}
}
```

According to [Package gob](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/gob/): `Interface values are transmitted as a string identifying the concrete type being sent (a name that must be pre-defined by calling Register), followed by a byte count of the length of the following data (so the value can be skipped if it cannot be stored), followed by the usual encoding of concrete (dynamic) value stored in the interface value.`.

I did not use `gob.Register()` to register `Op` and `Args`. The result was that when Raft leader sent Log to follower, the follower received a Log with `nil` `Op`.

## FAQ

Here are my thoughts when implementing Lab 4A:

> Q: In the test file of Lab 4A, a `shardmaster` has `nservers`. Also, it can receive a `gid` with several severs. What is the difference between servers in `nservers` and servers in `gid`?

A: `shardmaster` uses Raft to implement a fault-tolerant service of `nservers`. The servers in `gid` is the meta data of `sharded Key-value servers`. That is, a `gid` maps to a `Replica Group` and the servers of a `gid` is the servers inside a `Replica Group`.
